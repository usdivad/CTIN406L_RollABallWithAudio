# Roll-A-Ball-With-Audio

Roll-A-Ball, now with sound! For USC course CTIN 406L: Sound Design for Games.

Based on Unity's [Roll-A-Ball tutorial](https://learn.unity.com/project/roll-a-ball), adapting the [completed project files](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/tutorial-projects/unity-learn-roll-a-ball-completed-project-files-urp-77198) and adding newly implemented audio.

## Your Assignment

2. **Replace all existing audio** with new sound assets that you create
3. (Optional) **Implement new audio** where there previously was none
	- Some ideas:
		- VO for each pickup that matches the current pickup count
		- A third sound zone with new looping ambience
		- Fading out the music once the player wins
4. **Create a Windows build**, zip it, and upload the zip using the form provided in class
