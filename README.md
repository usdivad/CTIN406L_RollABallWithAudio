# Roll-A-Ball-With-Audio

Roll-A-Ball, now with sound! For USC course CTIN 406L: Sound Design for Games.

Based on Unity's [Roll-A-Ball tutorial](https://learn.unity.com/project/roll-a-ball), adapting the [completed project files](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/tutorial-projects/unity-learn-roll-a-ball-completed-project-files-urp-77198) and adding newly implemented audio.

##  Week 5 Reference: Ambience
1. [Download the `week5-ambiences` version of the project](https://github.com/usdivad/CTIN406L_RollABallWithAudio/archive/refs/heads/week5-ambiences.zip) and open Assets/Scenes/Week5_Ambience.unity
2. These scripts in Assets/Scripts/Audio may be particularly helpful for **Project 1**:
	- DistanceBasedAmbienceZone.cs
	- TriggerBasedAmbienceZone.cs

## Week 4 Assignment: Audio Replacement
1. [Download the `week4-implementation` version of the project](https://github.com/usdivad/CTIN406L_RollABallWithAudio/archive/refs/heads/week4-implementation.zip) and open Assets/Scenes/RollABallWithAudio.unity
2. **Replace all existing audio** with new sound assets that you create
3. (Optional) **Implement new audio** where there previously was none
	- Some ideas:
		- VO for each pickup that matches the current pickup count
		- A third sound zone with new looping ambience
		- Fading out the music once the player wins
4. **Create a Windows build**, zip it, and upload the zip using the form provided in class
5. Come to class prepared to share and discuss with everyone!
